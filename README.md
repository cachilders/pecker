I'm making an e-paper typewriter. This'll be the cloud-based word processor at its heart. Right now it's super specific to my hardware (RPi3 and a WaveShare 4.2 e-paper display) and in a state of pure exploration--so probably don't look too closely for too long or your eyes might melt.

Also most of this initial commit is just modifications of the WaveShare driver demo software in Python and liiterally nothing comparable to an actual application. You have to start somewhere, friends.
